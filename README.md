COVID for kids provides a resource for young children to learn about the virus in a digestible, simplified way. Our website includes a simplified map and links to child friendly resources.

**Tack & Problem of Focus**

We chose the education track and we focused on making COVID-19 information more accessible and easy to understand for children

**Solution & Main Features**

We created a website that presents simplified COVID-19 data and resources for youth to better understand the current pandemic since available information is difficult to understand. 

**What we accomplished**

We created the basic framework for the website using React. We successfully created an interactive graph of the United States that automatically draws the daily number of COVID cases from various news sources. The data is used to create a heat map across the graphic and the user can hover over each county to see the number of cases there. This differs from current COVID-19 data sources as the information is simplified and clearly presented. We also included a page with more resources for kids to continue learning about the current state of COVID-19. 

**Challenges or limitations**

Presenting simplified information for kids about such a complex problem is a challenge. Some counties also do not have updated COVID-19 data which results in an undefined data field. We are still figuring out how to process null data from this dataset.

**Future extensions**

In the future, we would provide more resources for kids to use. We would also develop a background section that describes what COVID-19 is and what kids can do to keep from getting it. Lastly, we would add a section walking kids through how to make their own PPE from home.
